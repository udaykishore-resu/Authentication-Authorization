A cookie is a file that holds information that a server can write to a client's machine if a client allows cookies to be written. For every request to a particular domain, the client's web browser first looks to see if there is a cookie from that domain on the client machine. With each request to that domain, the browser will send a cookie if a cookie has been written for that particular domain.
